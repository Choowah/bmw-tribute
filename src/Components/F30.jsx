                    <h2 className="font-bold">Built: 2011-2019</h2>
                    <h2 className="font-bold">Power: 85-338 kW / 116-460 hp</h2>
                    <h2 className="mb-[2vh] font-bold">Variants: Sedan, Touring, Gran Turismo, M3</h2>
                    <p>“Game of Thrones” began its march of triumph on screens around the world, singer Adele won six Grammy Awards and director Michel Hazanavicius created a beautiful homage to the silent movie era with his film “The Artist”.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the BMW 3 Series went electric! For the first time, the range of engines included hybrid options (the ActiveHybrid 3, followed by the 330e iPerformance). All of the engines were also turbocharged.</p>
                    <p>The design was an evolution of its predecessor, being more strongly aligned with that of the larger BMW 5 Series. One striking detail was that the headlamps now connecting to the kidney grille.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the sixth generation had also evolved in terms of its size, with the launch of a longer Gran Turismo version. The new variant added a coupé roof profile to the sedan and featured a longer wheelbase. The benefit, especially for passengers in the rear, was greater leg and headroom.</p>

                    <h2 className="mb-[2vh] font-bold">Increased Personalization</h2>
                    <p>Individual styling was given greater emphasis. In line with the spirit of the times, customers were free to customize the equipment spec, choosing from a wider range of materials, colors, and fabrics. There were now three other trim levels available beside the familiar M sports package: the Modern line, Sports line, and Luxury line.</p>
                    <h2 className="my-[2vh] font-bold">Two of the 3 Series Models Renamed as 4 Series</h2>
                    <p>Spinning off the coupé and convertible models to create a new series was something that had already been a topic of discussion 20 years ago, at the time of the third-generation BMW 3 Series. With the sixth generation it became reality. While the Sedan, Touring, and Gran Turismo remained under the BMW 3 Series label, the Convertible, Coupé, and the new Gran Coupé formed their own family: the BMW 4 Series.</p>
