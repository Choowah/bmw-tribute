                    <h2 className="font-bold">Built: 1975-1983</h2>
                    <h2 className="font-bold">Power: 55-105kW / 75-143hp</h2>
                    <h2 className="mb-[2vh] font-bold">Variants: Sedan (2-door), Convertible (Baur Topcabriolet)</h2>
                    <p>It’s the year 1975: “Jaws” was selling out movie theaters and breaking box office records worldwide. Youngsters wore flares and platform shoes, and the mini-skirt was still the height of fashion.</p>
                    <p>At Munich’s Olympic Stadium, the first BMW 3 Series – the two-door sedan is the successor to the legendary BMW 02 Series – was unveiled to the world. The design was the brainchild of Paul Bracq, BMW Director of Design from 1970 to 1974. The BMW 3 Series sedan was unmatched in terms of its dynamic and sporting performance, thereby laying the foundations for a story of success that has continued to this day.</p>

                    <h2 className="mb-[2vh] font-bold">An Eye-Catching Tail End</h2>
                    <p>The first generation of the BMW 3 Series was famous for its distinctive profile with its raised tail section and the crease line along the body. Seen from behind, the rear section wasn’t to everyone’s taste, especially the part between the tail lights. Only a few months after the start of production, the designers added a black plastic trim to the rear.</p>
                    <p>The first models in the BMW 3 Series range were a sedan – and the legendary Baur Topcabriolet (1977-1982). Stuttgart-based Baur GmbH was in charge of the transformation of 4,595 BMW 3 Series into convertibles, which featured a rollover bar and fixed roof frame.</p>
                    <h2 className="my-[2vh] font-bold">A Standard Feature was Born</h2>
                    <p>The first-generation BMW 3 Series included one innovation that was to become a standard feature in all BMW models: a dashboard angled toward the driver.</p>
                    <p>Other design details – such as the short overhang at the front, the double-kidney grille, the crease line along the body, the twin headlamps found on several models, and the Hofmeister kink at the C-pillar – have lived on as stylistic features in subsequent generations.</p>
